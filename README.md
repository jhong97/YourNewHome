### Description
Our goal is to enable potential owners to find the right pet, giving each shelter pet a chance to find a new home. We ask users for a short questionnaire help match our database of pets in local shelters to the user, using a simple liking mechanism to determine pets that you are interested in. Found a pet you love? We'll link you to the appropriate shelter so you can meet them yourselves.
